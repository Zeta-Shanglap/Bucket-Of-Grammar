    <dd style="color: darkkhaki">The Buster Shot (バスターショット Basutā Shotto) is Zero's long-range weapon; alongside the Z-saber, it appears in all Mega Man Zero games. It was originally an old model of a handheld gun used by the late Milan. When Zero awoke, he grabbed Milan's weapon in order to defend Ciel and himself against the attacking Neo Arcadian troops. Once acquired, the Buster Shot's bullets directly changed from regular ammunition to energy shots (or at least appears to in-game), and once the Z-Saber is obtained, the gun can be charged with its help (early concept art and the illustration to the left show that the Z-Saber can be loaded into the buster as a power cell, granting the weapon the ability to be charged this way). Like the Zero series version of the Z-Saber, the Buster Shot can be equipped with element chips, and it had to be upgraded in the first two games. According to concept art, the Buster Shot is mounted onto Zero's back when not used</dd>

    <dd style="color: darkkhaki">In this series, Zero's Z-Saber has been redesigned and reconfigured along with Zero himself. The Z-Saber now no longer possesses a lightsaber-like appearance, but a deltoid-shaped blade. Furthermore, the Z-Saber received a few upgrades. Unlike in the Mega Man X series, the Zero series Z-Saber can be used while running and dashing (however, no combos can be performed while in motion). Additionally, it was created using the same technology as the X-Buster, giving it the ability to be charged and vary its effects and shape. The Z-Saber can be equipped with different chips for element-based charge attacks. In the first two games, Zero has to "relearn" his skill with the Z-Saber, upgrading its attack power and moveset by frequently using it, thus leveling it up. The weapon's most interesting characteristic is the sheer amount of force it can dole out to enemies; it can easily slice through 300 mm of reinforced steel in a single stroke. The Z-Saber can be recharged by drawing energy from Zero himself, who has an internal solar core. Zero can put the Z-Saber into the Buster Shot, allowing it to use vastly more powerful shots and charge shots. Cerveau studies the Z-Saber and reverse-engineers it, allowing it to change
